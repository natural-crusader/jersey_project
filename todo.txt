We would like a small web application that touches on database, PHP, HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX. 

This app should access a MySQL database table called ‘user’ 
that has the following columns: 
user_id, name, access_count, modify_dt. 

That table should have several rows in it, each with distinct data. 

The database should be accessed using an instance of a PHP class that manages the connection and provides methods for accessing the user table. 

A PHP class that generates a page containing a tabular form should be written that includes all of the columns from the user table; 
it should list all of the rows. 

Each row should have a button that, when clicked, uses AJAX to bump the access_count and update the modify_dt of the selected user using the server’s time. 

The form should be updated to reflect the current access_count and modify_dt without reloading the page itself. 

A page-level PHP script should be written that brings all of these elements together. 

CSS should be used for styling; inline styles should be avoided. 

This code should not be based on an existing PHP or JS framework (other than jQuery). 

The code should be structured in a way that would easily accommodate either additional functionality to this page or additional pages without adding undue complexity to the current implementation.
